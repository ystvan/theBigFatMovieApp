# TheBigFatMovieApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Side infos

This single page app was made for an "HTML5 and Javascript frameworks" lecture, as a 3rd mandatory assignment.

## The requirements were the following:
Your own Angular App
The third option is to build your own WebApp. The only demands are:

a) The app must have as minimum 3 Components. 
b) The app must have a Service-class and use dependency injection to inject the Service into a component.
c) The app must use the following type of bindings: - string interpolation, property binding and event binding.
d) The app must use Routing & Navigation.

e) The app should use a HttpService (you are most welcome to use FireBase as Backend)
f) The app should use Interface, Observable/subscribe( ), map( ) and filter( ) (RxJS)

## The app was made by using the free API services of THEMOVIEDB.ORG
